# multiple-image-classification
This is a Supervised Machine Learning model for multiple image classifications using python
I have utilized the cifar10 dataset fron toronto for training the model.
The dataset contains 50,000 images subdivided into 10 classes.

HOW GOOD IS THE MODEL?
Although the model has an accuracy of 61% which is not very good, it classifies multiple images each with a good confidence level.
